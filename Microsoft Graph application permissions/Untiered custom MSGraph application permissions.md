# ❔ Untiered custom MS Graph application permissions

> [!NOTE] 
> <u>Built-in</u> MS Graph application permissions that are currently untiered are available in the upstream [Azure Administrative Tiering (AAT)](https://github.com/emiliensocchi/azure-tiering/blob/main/Microsoft%20Graph%20application%20permissions/Untiered%20MSGraph%20application%20permissions.md) project.

The creation of **custom** MS Graph application permissions is not possible at the moment. This page is only here as a placeholder.
