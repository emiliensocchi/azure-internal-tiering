# ❔ Untiered Azure roles

> [!NOTE] 
> <u>Common</u> <u>built-in</u> Azure roles that are currently untiered are available in the upstream [Azure Administrative Tiering (AAT)](https://github.com/emiliensocchi/azure-tiering/issues) project as issues.

This project uses some level of automation to detect the addition of the following Azure roles during the **last 24 hours**:

- All **custom** roles
- **Built-in** Azure roles currently assigned, but untiered [upstream](https://github.com/emiliensocchi/azure-tiering/tree/main/Azure%20roles)

The reader should keep in mind that **those roles need to be tiered manually** by the team responsible for implementing this project.


## 🔎 Latest detections

The **assignment** of the following roles has been detected through automation, **since the last update** of the tier model:

| Detected on | Azure role | Type |  Description |
